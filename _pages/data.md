## Clusters and Danish Industry Classifications

For our book, "*The Spatial Ecology of Entrepreneurship*" (Dahl & Sorenson, forthcoming), we are using the distinction between traded and local clusters from the US Cluster Mapping Project by Mercedes Delgado, Michael E. Porter, and Scott Stern. The purpose of their project is to define and categorize traded industry clusters in the US economy based on NAICS codes, providing detailed lists and descriptions of each cluster. These clusters are used in economic development analysis, regional policy making, and competitive strategy.
